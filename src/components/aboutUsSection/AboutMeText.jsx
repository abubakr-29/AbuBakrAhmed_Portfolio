          I'm a developer driven by curiosity, creativity, and the desire to
          solve meaningful problems through technology. What began as casual
          experimentation during college quickly evolved into a deeper passion
          for building digital solutions that are both functional and impactful.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Over time, I've transitioned from coding personal projects to
          developing real-world applications, gaining valuable insight into not
          just the technical side of development, but also the importance of
          user experience, clear communication, and collaboration.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Outside of coding, I dedicate myself to physical training, continuous
          learning, and self-reflection â€” all part of my broader goal to grow as
          both a developer and a person who contributes value wherever possible.
